<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, 
<br><br>
  My name is Vasiliki Loli, I am currently 23 years old and I am from a small city called Paramythia.
  I just finished my Computer Science Degree in Ionian University,
  Corfu, with a major in Computer Science in the field of Human Sciences.
  After getting this degree, I aspire to extend my studies by getting a 
  Master's Degree in the field of Game Development. My thesis was relevant to that, it was about 
  recording Serious Games' and Gamification trends in general, while also conducting
  a survey on secondary education teachers in Greece about their use in classroom,
  their attitudes towards them and how their attitudes can be altered due
  to some spesific variables.
